# Multicollinearity Model Comparison in R

This repository contains R code for comparing different models with multicollinearity.

## Overview

Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. This code compares the performance of different models in the presence of multicollinearity.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Open the R script in RStudio.
3. Run the script to compare the models.
4. Adjust the parameters and models as needed for your analysis.

## Dependencies

This code relies on the following R packages:

- matlib
- MASS
- betareg
- rBeta2009

Install these packages using `install.packages()` if you haven't already.
